**Conclusion:** 
Context-window doesn't affect after offload all moe layers to CPU.
When you set `--n-cpu-moe N`, you are telling the runtime to offload N MoE blocks (layers with experts) to CPU memory.
- Those layers no longer sit in GPU VRAM â€” freeing GPU memory.
- But every time the model executes those layers, it has to transfer activations from GPU â†’ CPU â†’ GPU.
- This slows down inference due to PCIe latency and bandwidth limits.

So, increasing n-cpu-moe reduces VRAM usage but increases CPU load and memory transfer overhead.

# 2. Verification command use to check is LLM agent api working
```bash
# at another host
curl http://10.100.10.15:5000
# output should be : {"message":"FYP Agent is running ðŸš€"}

curl -X POST "http://10.100.10.15:5000/generate" \

     -d '{"prompt": "Make sure 10.0.0.1 can communicate 10.0.0.2"}'
